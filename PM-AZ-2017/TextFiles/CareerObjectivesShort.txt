	The ideal career for me is to be a part of a team that provides IT solutions to real world problems.  This can be through the creation of applications (database, user interface, and tools) that accomplish something that is currently done manually, or it can be making existing work more efficient and pleasant for the user.  What’s most satisfying to me in application development is leveraging technology to improve decision making and the user experience.

	The ideal position would utilize some of the experience that I’ve gained in project management and technical work over the years; to know that I’m contributing my best attributes to the work I’m completing and learning and improving in the areas where I need knowledge and improving.
