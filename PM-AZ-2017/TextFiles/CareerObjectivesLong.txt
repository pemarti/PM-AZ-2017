	The ideal career for me is to be a part of a team that provides IT solutions to real world problems.  This can be through the creation of applications (database, user interface, and tools) that accomplish something that is currently done manually, or it can be making existing work more efficient and pleasant for the user.  What’s most satisfying to me in application development is leveraging technology to improve decision making and the user experience.

<p>
	I consider myself as an expert of no one technology in particular, but to have the skills in almost every stage in the application development process, from the initial meeting with the client (or stake holders) to providing on-going user support and everything in between.
